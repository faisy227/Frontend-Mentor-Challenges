      <h2> I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned  were current, if not more so, 
       in the company I joined. I <br>  honestly feel I got every penny‚Äôs worth.</h2>
       <p>‚Äú I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I‚Äôve been looking to make a 
         transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up 
         for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
         The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
         the course, I‚Äôve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ‚Äù</p>

      <p>‚Äú I started as a total newbie with virtually no coding skills. I now work as a mobile engineer 
        for a big company. This was one of the best investments I‚Äôve made in myself. ‚Äù</p>

    <h2> Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h2>
   
    <p>‚Äú Before joining the bootcamp, I‚Äôve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from 
     professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former 
     student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff 
     did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team 
     project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial 
     could ever have. In fact, I‚Äôve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent 
     experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 
     100% recommend! ‚Äù</p>

       <h2>Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and 
         learning from <br> their experiences was easy.</h2>
     
       <p>‚Äú The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program 
         gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable 
         junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from 
         an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ‚Äù</p>
